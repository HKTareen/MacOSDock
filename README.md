# MacOS Dock Assignment

This project demonstrates a customized implementation of a MacOS-style Dock with interactive and visually appealing features. The primary goal was to achieve functionality resembling the MacOS Dock using Flutter within the constraints of available tools and frameworks.

To accomplish this, the `reorderables` package was customized, and a total of **14 hours** was dedicated to the assignment.

## Achievements

1. **Magnification Animation**  
   Smooth and visually appealing magnification effect when hovering over or interacting with items on the Dock.

2. **Draggable Items**  
   Items on the Dock can be dynamically dragged and reordered for enhanced usability.

3. **Space Reduction when Out of Dock**  
   The Dock automatically reduces spacing when an item is removed, ensuring a compact and consistent layout.

## Customization Details

The `reorderables` package was customized to achieve the following:
- Precise magnification animations.
- Seamless drag-and-drop functionality.
- Dynamic space adjustment when items are removed or rearranged.

## Development Timeline

**Total Time Spent:** 14 Hours
- Customizing the `reorderables` package: 8 hours
- Implementing animations and interactivity: 4 hours
- Debugging and fine-tuning: 2 hours

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HKTareen/MacOSDock.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MacOSDock
   
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
   
4. Run the app:
     ```bash
    flutter run

# Notes
## This project closely replicates the MacOS Dock's behavior using Flutter, showcasing the flexibility of the framework. While achieving near-identical functionality, some platform-specific differences were inevitable.

## Feel free to explore, test, and share feedback.
